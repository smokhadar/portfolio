# Description

This portfolio includes an about me section, several work project examples, and contact information for potential employers interested in hiring me for software development. All projects currently link to my github profile and navigation links on the left aside bar direct users to the appropriate section.

I used HTML to create the structure of the webpage and CSS to add styling. CSS includes flex boxes for responsive styling and media queries to adjust the browser content depending on the user's screen size.

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://smokhadar.github.io/portfolio-samira/

This project was based on the following requirements: 

## User Story
AS A marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards WHEN I view the source code THEN I find semantic HTML elements WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning WHEN I view the icon and image elements THEN I find accessible alt attributes WHEN I view the heading attributes THEN they fall in sequential order WHEN I view the title element THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
